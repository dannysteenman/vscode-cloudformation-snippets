## New

- Added support for [Gitpod](https://github.com/dannysteenman/vscode-cloudformation-snippets/issues/14) by publishing this extension to the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/dsteenman/cloudformation-yaml-snippets)


## Features

1. Supports all resources that are defined by CloudFormation
2. CloudFormation autocompletion for every resource (includes properties).
3. The CloudFormation snippets are automatically updated every week after AWS updates their [CloudFormation Resource Specification.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html)
4. Intrinsic functions + conditions are supported.
5. Contains a whole bunch of parameter types.
6. Has builtin support for placeholders. This means you can quickly jump from property to property in each resource by using `Tab`
7. Every resource type contains the matching documentation URL in its description.

## Usage

* **Step 1.** Install this extension
* **Step 2.** create a `.yml` file to start working on CloudFormation
* **Step 3.** Check in the bottom right-hand corner of the VS Code editor that the file type is listed as "YAML".
* **Step 4.** To start with the basic template structure, type **cfn** to get the YAML formatted template fragment.
* **Step 5.** Start adding resources in the resource section by using their prefix name e.g. ```autoscaling-autoscalinggroup``` equals resource type ```AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup```

> **Note:** Once you start typing a prefix (explained in step 5), the corresponding snippet will show up in the dropdown menu. If this doesn't happen automatically, press `ctrl + space` to invoke IntelliSense and search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add (as listed in step 5).
