Is AWS complexity draining your engineering resources? Most B2B startups and growing businesses struggle with overwhelming configuration options, time-consuming compliance requirements, and diverting valuable developer talent away from core product development. Without specialized AWS expertise, you risk security vulnerabilities, mounting technical debt, and delayed time-to-market. All while your competitors race ahead.

Traditional AWS consultancies only compound this problem. They're incentivized to bill by the hour, extending projects indefinitely rather than focusing on your business outcomes. We take the opposite approach. Our fixed-price subscription model proves how confident we are in delivering results, not just billable hours. We succeed when you succeed, aligning our incentives with your growth rather than your AWS complexity.

## Our Solution: Enterprise-Grade AWS Foundation

We deliver an enterprise-grade AWS Landing Zone built entirely in AWS CDK coupled with a support and consultacy foundation that grows with your business needs. Here's what we'll deliver to you:

### We deploy a [Secure and Compliant Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone)
- Multi-account architecture with proper security boundaries
  - Achieves a **100% score on the industry-standard [CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html)**
  - **Achieves a 96% rating on AWS's own [foundational security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html)**
- Setup entirely using AWS CDK (Infrastructure as Code)
- Budget monitoring and notifications across all accounts
- Deploy changes quickly through GitHub Actions
- We're continuously adding new features as listed on our [Roadmap](https://github.com/towardsthecloud/aws-cdk-landing-zone-roadmap)

- They receive guidance on how to utilize AWS best practices for your architecture so you avoid technical debt later on

### We monitor and maintain the multi-account setup & provide ongoing support

- Get priority support through Slack/Teams whenever you need assistance with infrastructure challenges
- We proactively do quarterly [security](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review) and [cost optimization](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) assessments to verify AWS account compliance and provide advice to reduce your AWS bill

### What This Means For Your Business
- **30% Lower TCO**: Cut your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by up to 30% through right-sized resources and architectural optimization while eliminating the $150K+ annual cost of a specialized AWS hire
- **Close Enterprise Deals Faster**: Win enterprise clients with SOC2 compliance ready in weeks instead of months - our clients report 50% faster sales cycles with security-conscious customers
- **Unleash Your Development Team**: Redirect up to 30% of engineering time from infrastructure back to revenue-generating product features with our pre-built, compliant components
- **Scale Without Infrastructure Headaches**: Grow from startup to enterprise without ever rebuilding your foundation - our architecture scales seamlessly from your first customer to your millionth

We deliver all of this as a [simple subscription service](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing). No large upfront costs, no lock-in. You'll essentially get a solid and secure landing zone foundation + a decade of AWS expertise without having to hire a full-time Cloud Engineer.

2. Create a new `.yml` or `.json` file.
3. Ensure the file type is set to "YAML" or "JSON" in the bottom right corner of VS Code.
4. Type cfn to insert the basic CloudFormation template structure.
5. Add resources using their short prefix (e.g. `s3-bucket` for `AWS::S3::Bucket`).

Example of auto-completion in action:
