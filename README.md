## New in version 5!

- Added support for all the AWS SAM resource types:

```YAML
    AWS::Serverless::Api
    AWS::Serverless::Application
    AWS::Serverless::Connector
    AWS::Serverless::Function
    AWS::Serverless::GraphQLApi
    AWS::Serverless::HttpApi
    AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion
    AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable
    AWS::Serverless::StateMachine
```

## Features

1. Contains snippets for **all AWS CloudFormation and SAM resources**.
2. Supports both YAML and JSON CloudFormation templates.
3. Autocomplete by typing the resource name, e.g., `ec2-instance` loads a snippet for `AWS::EC2::Instance`.
4. Includes intrinsic functions, conditions, and a variety of parameter types.
5. Utilizes placeholders for quick navigation within the properties of each resource.
6. Provides documentation links for each resource.
7. Automatically updates weekly with the latest [CloudFormation Resource Specification.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html)
8. Available on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/dannysteenman/cloudformation-yaml-snippets) for [Gitpod support.](https://github.com/dannysteenman/vscode-cloudformation-snippets/issues/14)

## Usage

* **Step 1.** Install this extension
* **Step 2.** create a `.yml` file to start working on CloudFormation
* **Step 3.** Check in the bottom right-hand corner of the VS Code editor that the file type is listed as "YAML".
* **Step 4.** To start with the basic template structure, type **cfn** to get the YAML formatted template fragment.
* **Step 5.** Start adding resources in the resource section by using their prefix name e.g. ```autoscaling-autoscalinggroup``` equals resource type ```AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup```

> **Note:** Once you start typing a prefix (explained in step 5), the corresponding snippet will show up in the dropdown menu. If this doesn't happen automatically, press `ctrl + space` to invoke IntelliSense and search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add (as listed in step 5).

## AWS CloudFormation Attributes (GetAtt) Cheat Sheet

It can be difficult to find out which attributes are available for each AWS CloudFormation resource type. Therefore I made an [AWS CloudFormation Attributes cheat sheet](https://towardsthecloud.com/aws-cloudformation-resource-attributes) that lists the attributes in a single table overview to easily find the attributes.
